## üîê Cybersecurity Student | Linux Enthusiast | Security Tools Builder  

## üéØ Learn. Break. Defend.  

I'm currently enrolled in a cybersecurity bootcamp, learning both offensive and defensive security through hands-on labs and real-world projects. From system hardening and penetration testing to SIEM log analysis and network-wide DNS filtering, I‚Äôve built up a strong toolkit for defending modern infrastructure. My focus is on practical skills, scripting, and diving into tools used in professional environments.

### **SIEM Log Analysis Project** | *(URL to repo coming soon)*  
- **Summary:** Worked as part of a team simulating a security operations center (SOC) for a company called Virtual Space Industries. We used Splunk to ingest Windows Server and Apache Web logs, configured reports and thresholds, built visual dashboards, and created alerts for suspicious behavior such as brute-force login attempts, excessive POST requests, account deletions, and HTTP 404 spikes.  
- **Key Components:**
  - Splunk Dashboard & Alert Configuration
  - Windows and Apache Log Parsing
  - Incident Trend Analysis
  - Attack Signature Identification  
- **Key Skills:** Log correlation, alert tuning, dashboard creation, network traffic analysis, Splunk query language (SPL)  
- **Role:** Group contributor  
- **Tools:** Splunk, Windows Event Logs, Apache Access Logs, IP Geolocation API

### **Pi-hole Network Security Tool Project** | [YouTube Demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X0b2LEVQlQ)  
- **Summary:** Led the configuration and demonstration of a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W running Pi-hole, a DNS-level ad blocker that enhances network security and performance. Created a tutorial to walk users through OS loading, installation, configuration, and customization (including blocklists and VPN integration). Demonstrated real-time ad blocking and dashboard insights across multiple devices.  
- **Key Components:**
  - DNS Sinkhole with Pi-hole
  - Raspberry Pi Setup and Optimization
  - Blocklist Customization for Privacy & Threat Defense
  - VPN Integration with WireGuard  
- **Key Skills:** DNS filtering, network security, Raspberry Pi administration, CLI setup, remote network protection  
- **Role:** Group contributor and video presenter  
- **Tools:** Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Pi-hole, Linux CLI, WireGuard VPN

### **Penetration Testing Project** | *(URL to repo coming soon)*  
- **Summary:** Conducted a black-box penetration test on a simulated corporate environment for Rekall Corp. Over three days, our team identified critical vulnerabilities across web applications, Linux servers, and Windows servers. Attacks included SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting, privilege escalation, and service exploitation. The final deliverable included a professional penetration testing report with screenshots, flags, and remediation recommendations.  
- **Key Components:**
  - Web App Exploitation (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection)
  - Linux Server Privilege Escalation (Shellshock, CVEs)
  - Windows Server Exploitation (SLMail, NTLM hash dump)
  - Active Directory Enumeration and DCSync Attack  
- **Key Skills:** Vulnerability exploitation, recon/scanning, Metasploit, privilege escalation, report writing, web and OS-level attack simulation  
- **Role:** Pen Tester  
- **Tools:** Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nmap, Nessus, Kali Linux
